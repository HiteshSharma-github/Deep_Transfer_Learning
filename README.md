# Deep_Transfer_Learning
Here we are going to present various Deep and Transfer Learning algorithms and showcase their use with kaggle datasets.

## Excercise 1
We are going to implement CNN for classification of Cats vs Dogs dataset and also play with the architecture to see the working of the algorithm.
